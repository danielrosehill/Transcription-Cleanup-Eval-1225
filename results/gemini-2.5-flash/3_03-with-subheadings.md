Here are some notes for the next time I run Claude, helping me develop the website, My Word Prompts.

### Homepage Review

**General**
*   The new header looks really good. I like it an awful lot.

**Sections**
*   **"Human Curiosity Meets AI Exploration"**: Maybe that subtitle could be a little bit bolder.
*   **"What is My Word Prompts?"**: I think it would actually be better if we just had a button in the center called "About this Podcast," and then beneath that...
*   **How it Works**: The concept is pretty straightforward: I record prompts, they get sent to an AI model, it generates a podcast episode using text-to-speech voices. All that detail is better kept for the about page. So I just want to have the essential here: "How this works."
    *   Second title: "Daniel records prompts," "AI answers," "episode generation." If we can use icons for those three labels, with a standard icon library.
*   **Colors**: I like the dark blue very much. I think that's a good palette for the project, as long as that kind of silver-white gradient for the actual text on top of it creates good color contrast. Let's try to stick with that.
*   **Latest Episode & All Episodes**: These titles, I think, would be better off a bit bigger and center-aligned.
*   **Fonts**: The font is good, but for the font for these elements, the headers, I think we could use something a bit more creative and imaginative.

### Navigation Bar

*   **Order**: The order of the top navigation items can be "Episodes," "About."
*   **Pipeline**: "Pipeline" can be subsumed, or rather a sub-menu under "About" in a drop-down.

### Contact Page

*   For the moment, on the contact page, I think we can get rid of "Got a Word Prompt?" inviting people to send in prompts, because I don't think that's going to be viable for a while at least.
*   Let's try to just use the background, that blue background, here.
*   Then, just on one level, I don't think we need a card for each of these boxes, just like "Show Email," "Contact Email," "Website GitHub," like little buttons. I think that's sufficient for providing a way for anyone to get in touch if they want to.
