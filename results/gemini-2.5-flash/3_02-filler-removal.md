These are some notes for the next time I run Claude, helping me develop the website, My Word Prompts.
So, homepage, page by page review. Homepage, new header looks really good. I like it an awful lot actually. Human curiosity meets AI exploration.
Maybe just that subtitle a little bit bolder. And then we have the next item is, what is My Word Prompts? And we have the intro. I think it would actually be better if we just had a button in the center called about this podcast.
Then beneath that, because the concept is pretty, is pretty straightforward. I record prompts, they get sent to an AI model, it generates a podcast episode using text-to-speech voices. But all that detail is is better better kept for the About page. So, I just want to have the essential here, how this works. Second title, Daniel records prompts, AI answers, episode generation. And if we can use icons for those three labels, with a standard icon library, and I like the dark blue very much. I think that's a good palette for the project. So long as that kind of silver white gradient for the actual text on top of it creates good color contrast. So, let's try to stick with that. Latest episode and all episode. These titles, I think would be better off a bit bigger and center aligned. And the font is good, but for the for the for these the the font for these elements, the headers, I think we could use something a bit more creative and imaginative.
In terms of then the top navigation bar, I think the the order can be Episodes.
About.
Pipeline can be subsumed or rather a sub menu under About in in a drop down.
And then for the moment, the contact page. I think we can get rid of "Got a word prompt", inviting people to send in prompts because I don't think that's going to be viable for a while at least. And let's try to just use the background, that blue background here and then I'm just on one level. I don't think we need a card a card for each of these boxes, just show email, contact email, website GitHub. Little buttons. I think that's that's sufficient for providing a way for anyone to get in touch if they want to.
