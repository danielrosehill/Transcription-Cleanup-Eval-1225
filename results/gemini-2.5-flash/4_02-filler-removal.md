Okay, so editing instructions for my personal website. I haven't looked at this in a while. Okay, so for the project's homepage, which is kind of important because I like to share what I'm working on. I asked I wanted my word prompts the podcast that I've been planning for a while. So, okay, I didn't want flagship project to be actually written and purple looks kind of stupid. And projects kind of encompasses both tech repositories as well as publishing efforts. So for example, my word prompts is I would say we can have a section here called content. And there's a bit of overlap with the content dropdown. But it can be this project, AI-generated podcast, you can actually be described as. And it's not 3,000 prompts, that's a different project completely. And this one is just AI-generated podcast. I provide prompts. They get read in the form of an AI response and that gets combined into one episode. That's the concept of it. So, I was The project's homepage is important because I want to just sort of have a place where I kind of show the stuff that I'm working on, without getting swamped in all these all the detail, because there's a lot of stuff that I've been adding to the site. So, maybe we can have dropdown elements within development, data research. And I think there's actually more to it than that. I'm just looking under projects, we have I click on by category, the main ones, evaluations and experiments are something I'm very interested in. Awesome lists, resource list is how we refer to them. So I think that could be Claude code, definitely. And MCP. Those would be the big ones. And voice and speech tools. Those are the big ones where I see my main areas of focus in AI and on the projects I'm working on, those would be like kind of the top levels I'd like to kind of highlight here. So I think that data data is a good one to have, but that would be a better organization and then maybe linking off to those category pages. And some of these some of these the question is really what's the kind of hierarchy here. So those ones I defined are kind of I guess things like apps and GUIs, I like to have that as a category because I want people to anyone wants to see any utilities I've created. That's important to have as a page, but it might span apps, CLIs, because that's a very big category we have CLIs, GUIs scripts, across different categories. So, maybe the best way to do that is to have this as the landing page as it is with the top levels I defined. And then a navigation bar with linking to category pages by category. Apps as its own thing, as its own top level and documentation which we already have kind of embedded into the website as its own page. But that's a common one as well. So I think those are the ones I'd like to kind of reorganize a little bit. And then in the categories page that exists currently, we have some duplication. As an example, There is indexes and awesome list, which is great. Because I usually just I usually just call them resource list, that'll be a better name to be to be honest. And then we have awesome list and there's definitely no need for both. Those should be consolidated. Likewise, MCP servers, MCP integrations, that we should have one consolidated list of my MCP projects. So those are all the kind of combinations. And I know the the process is generally you can see how it's documented, but it's a pull from GitHub and hugging face to a backend data file, a JSON file with a bit of filtering. And then we kind of spread out to the category pages. So, we might need to implement those that categorization edits at that level as opposed to here, but let's let's work on on those changes.
