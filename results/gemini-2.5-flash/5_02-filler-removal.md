Okay, here's a prompt that I'd like you to work with to not just do things. Let's create. I think there's an AI analysis folder in this repository. If there isn't, create one, and rather than give you a task list, I'd like to get you some thoughts that we can then you can give me your suggestions and then I'll tell you which ones I like.

So we're going to just have a quick review of my personal website. The deployed site is danielrosel.com. This is the repository for working on it, basically. And we've gone through a few versions this year. This one is an updated model that pulls the project data from source, from GitHub and Hugging Face. And I think we mostly got rid, I think we got rid of entirely the Contentful approach to this, which was using a headless CMS. I'm using that for my blog, but I think it was just too complicated for this website because it's not particularly content rich.

I'll tell you really what the objectives are for me for this website. So I'm working on a lot of AI development projects this year and whatnot. And I have some YouTube channels that I really want to get back into creating, and some podcasts. And I think it's important to have a consolidated space on the internet where if anyone's curious, anyone wants to get in touch, wants just a list of the different things that I'm working on to to find information about me.

I've really leaned into just using AI tools with direction, and therefore some of the things written were not actually written by me. I did that deliberately because I wanted to get a bit of distance between me writing bios and getting ones that AI generated. So the one that I have currently is actually pretty decent. But I don't know if it's better if there should be a bit more of my personal story. I want the website, the objective is it's definitely professionally oriented in the sense that it's more about sharing what I'm working on than about me as a person. There's a little bit of a hiring hook here.

There are some issues, I'm just loading. Gosh, this is terrible, with the way in which the icons load. I haven't figured it out yet, and I would love to know if you can figure it out. It's when the page refreshes, they move around, it looks really bad.

So the hiring page is just there for mostly feeding into at the moment my business site. Eventually I want to have a proper website for that. I guess really what I'm thinking more is I like the content, I want to keep the content that we have. But I feel like it's still a little bit the hierarchy, the structure, the flow could be a lot more logical than it is. Documentation I put out was initially its own section, because I write docs and create docs. And then content gathers together little bits of the content that I create and have created.

So again, it's not just hire me off the internet website. And it's not just about me either. It's trying to just give, create sort of a clearing house or an aggregated presentation layer for all these different things I'm working on. And without any real mutual objective. I do definitely get a significant amount of contacts through the website. So it's useful for people to find me, I guess. And I also have just little things about I want it to be as AI friendly as possible. I believe that there's a huge just make whatever you can available, that's just my philosophy. So that's reflected in the footer design, but it's also reflected technically. So there's any other things that should be done differently from that perspective in terms of creating a clear hierarchy and a map. That's something that I'd like to spend time on as well.
