**Transcription:**

0:00:00 Okay, so some editing instructions for my personal website. Um, I haven't looked at this in a while.
0:00:08 Okay, so for the projects homepage, which is kind of important because I like to share what I'm working on. Um, I asked, I wanted my word prompts is the podcast that I've been planning for a while.
0:00:20 Um, so, okay. I don't, I didn't want flagship project to be actually written and purple looks kind of stupid.
0:00:29 Um,
0:00:34 and projects kind of encompasses both tech repositories as well as publishing efforts. So for example, my word prompts is, I would say, we can have a section here called content. And there's a bit of overlap with the content drop down. Um, but it can be this project, um, AI generated podcast you can actually be described as. And it's not 3,000 plus prompts. That's a different project completely. And this one is just, um, AI generated podcast. I provide prompts, they get read, um, in the form of an AI response, and that gets combined into one episode. That's the concept of it.
0:01:17 So, I was, the projects homepage is important because I want to just sort of have a place where, you know, I kind of show the stuff that I'm working on, without getting swamped in all these, all, you know, the detail, 'cause there's a lot of stuff that I've been adding to the site.
0:01:37 So, um, maybe we can have
0:01:44 dropdown elements within development, data research. And I think there's actually more to it than that. I'm just looking under projects, we have, if I click on by category, the main ones, evaluations and experiments are something I'm very interested in.
0:01:58 Awesome list, uh, resource list is how we refer to them. So I think that could be Claude Code, definitely.
0:02:10 Um, and MCP. Those would be the big ones. Uh, and voice and speech tools. Those are the big ones where I see my main areas of focus in, in AI, and on the projects I'm working on. Those would be like, kind of, the top levels I'd like to kind of
0:02:26 highlight here. So I think that like data, data's a good one to have, um, but those that would be a better organization and then maybe linking off to those category pages.
0:02:41 And some of these, some of these, the question is really what's the kind of hierarchy here? Um, so the, those, those ones I defined are kind of,
0:02:53 I guess things like apps and GUIs. I like to have that as a category because I want people to, you know, anyone wants to like see any utilities I've created. I like that's important to have as a page. But it might span, um, apps, CLIs, because that's a very big category. We have CLIs, GUIs, scripts across different categories.
0:03:14 So,
0:03:17 maybe the best way to do that is to have
0:03:20 this as the landing page as it is with the top levels I defined.
0:03:25 And then,
0:03:32 a navigation bar with linking to uh category pages by category. Apps as its own thing, as its own top level, and documentation, which we'll already have, um, kind of embedded into the website as its own page. But that's a common one as well. So I think those are the ones I'd like to kind of reorganize a little bit.
0:03:58 And then in the categories page that exists currently, we have some duplication. As an example,
0:04:08 there is 'indexes' and 'awesome list', which is great, because I usually just, I usually just call them 'resource list'. That'll be a better name, to be, to be honest. And then we have 'awesome list', and there's definitely no need for both. Those should be consolidated. Likewise, MCP servers, MCP integrations, that we should have one consolidated list of my MCP projects.
0:04:30 Um, so those are all the kind of combinations, and I know the pro the process is generally, um, you can see how it's documented, but it's a pull from GitHub and Hugging Face to a back-end data file, a JSON file, with a bit of filtering.
0:04:47 And then we kind of, um, spread out to the category pages. So, we might need to implement those, that categorization, edits, at that level as opposed to here, but, um, let's, let's work on, on those changes.

**Professional Rewrite:**

This document outlines proposed editing instructions for the personal website, specifically focusing on the projects homepage. It addresses current organizational challenges and suggests improvements.

The projects homepage serves as a central hub to showcase ongoing work and initiatives. Currently, "My Word Prompts," an AI-generated podcast, exemplifies the need for clearer project categorization. This project involves providing prompts that are then read by an AI, combining into a single episode, and is distinct from the "3000+ Prompts" project. The existing "Projects" category on the homepage is overly broad, encompassing both technical repositories and publishing efforts, leading to an overlap with the "Content" dropdown.

The primary objective is to present projects clearly without overwhelming users with excessive detail, especially given the continuous additions to the site.

To achieve this, we propose organizing the projects homepage with clearly defined top-level categories. Based on current work, these would include main areas of focus within AI: MCP, and Voice and Speech Tools. Other significant areas include "Evaluations and Experiments," "Resource Lists" (replacing "Awesome List"), and "Claude Code." While "Data" is a relevant category, it may function better as a sub-category.

The optimal organizational structure would likely involve the main projects page serving as a landing page for the defined top-level categories. A navigation bar would then link to specific category pages. This approach addresses the hierarchy question, particularly for categories like "Apps" and "GUIs," which are important enough to warrant their own dedicated page, despite potentially encompassing sub-categories like CLIs and scripts. Additionally, "Documentation" will be maintained as a standalone top-level page within the navigation.

A review of existing category pages has revealed duplication that requires consolidation. For example, "Indexes" and "Awesome List" should be combined under "Resource List." Similarly, "MCP Servers" and "MCP Integrations" will be unified into a single "MCP Projects" list.

The current project data management process involves pulling information from GitHub and Hugging Face, which is then stored in a backend JSON file with applied filtering. This data is subsequently utilized to populate the various category pages. Therefore, the proposed categorization and edits should primarily be implemented at this data-processing level rather than directly on the front end. We will proceed with implementing these changes.
