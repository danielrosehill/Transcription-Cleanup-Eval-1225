## Transcription:

00:00 Okay, these are some notes for the next time I run Claude, uh helping me develop the website, uh my word prompts.
00:07 So, homepage, page by page review. Homepage, um, new header looks really good. Like it an awful lot actually.
00:14 Um, human curiosity meets AI exploration.
00:18 Maybe just that subtitle a little bit bolder.
00:22 And then we have the next item is where what is my word prompts?
00:26 And we have the intro. I think it would actually be better if we just had a button in the center called about this podcast.
00:35 And then beneath that, because the concept is pretty is pretty straightforward. I record prompts, they get sent to an um AI model, it generates an a podcast episode using text-to-speech voices. But all that detail is is better better kept for the about page.
00:59 So, I just want to have the essential here: how this works. Second title: human, or Daniel, records prompts, AI answers, episode generation.
01:09 And if we can use icons for those three labels with a standard icon library. And I like the dark blue very much. I think that's a good palette for the project.
01:18 Um, so long as and that kind of silver-white gradient for the actual text on top of it, uh creates good color contrast. Um, so let's try to stick with that.
01:29 Latest episode and all episode, these titles, I think would be better off a bit bigger and center aligned.
01:35 Um, and the font is good, but for the for the for these the the font for these elements, the headers, I think we could use something a bit more creative and imaginative.
01:47 Um, in terms of then the top navigation bar, I think the um the order can be Episodes, About.
02:03 Pipeline can be subsumed or rather a sub-menu under About. in a drop-down.
02:17 And then for the moment, um the contact page, we I think we can get rid of got a word prompt inviting people to send in prompts because I don't think that's going to be viable for a while at least.
02:31 And uh let's try to just use the background, that blue background here and then I'm just on one level. I don't think we need a car a card for each of these boxes, just like show email, contact email, website, GitHub, like little buttons. I think that's that's sufficient for providing a way for anyone to get in touch if they want to.

## Professional, Business-Formal Rewrite:

These notes outline considerations for the next iteration of the website, specifically regarding the 'My Word Prompts' feature, with input from Claude.

**Homepage Review:**

*   **Header:** The new header design is highly effective. The current subtitle, "Human Curiosity Meets AI Exploration," should be presented in a bolder font.
*   **"What is My Word Prompts?" Section:** It is recommended to replace the current introductory text with a central button labeled "About This Podcast." The underlying concept (prompts are recorded, processed by an AI model, and generate podcast episodes using text-to-speech voices) should be concisely summarized on the homepage under a "How This Works" section. Detailed explanations of this process are better suited for the 'About' page.
*   **"How This Works" Section:** This section should briefly outline the three key stages:
    *   Prompts Recorded
    *   AI Answers
    *   Episode Generation
    *   Utilize a standard icon library to represent these three labels.
*   **Design & Color Palette:** The chosen dark blue palette, combined with a silver-white gradient for text overlays, provides excellent contrast and is highly suitable for the project. We should maintain this visual approach.
*   **Titles:** The "Latest Episode" and "All Episodes" titles should be increased in size and center-aligned.
*   **Header Fonts:** While the current font is acceptable, consider a more distinctive and imaginative font for header elements.

**Navigation Bar:**

*   **Order:** The proposed order for the top navigation bar is "Episodes" followed by "About."
*   **"Pipeline" Section:** The "Pipeline" section can be incorporated as a sub-menu within the "About" drop-down.

**Contact Page:**

*   **Prompt Submission:** We recommend removing the "Got a Word Prompt" section, as the functionality for user-submitted prompts is not currently a priority.
*   **Design Simplification:** The page design should be simplified by utilizing the existing blue background. Instead of individual cards or boxes, present contact options (e.g., email, website, GitHub) as concise, single-line links or buttons. This simplified approach is sufficient for enabling user contact.
