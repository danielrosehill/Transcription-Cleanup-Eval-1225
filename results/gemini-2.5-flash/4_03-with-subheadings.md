Here's a summary of the editing instructions for the personal website, with filler words removed and content organized under clear subheadings:

### Website Editing Instructions

These are editing instructions for my personal website, focusing on the projects section.

### Projects Homepage

The projects homepage is important because I want to share what I'm working on without getting swamped in all the detail. It should provide a place to showcase current work.

### "My Word Prompts" Project Clarification

"My Word Prompts" is an AI-generated podcast that involves me providing prompts, which are then read in the form of an AI response, and that gets combined into one episode. This is a distinct project from a general "3000+ prompts" concept. It is specifically an "AI-generated podcast," not just a collection of prompts.

### Broadening the "Projects" Definition

The term "projects" encompasses both tech repositories and publishing efforts. For example, "My Word Prompts" falls under publishing efforts, but the entire section should also include tech-related work.

### Proposed Top-Level Categories/Sections

I'd like to restructure the main project categories on the website. The current "Projects" menu is becoming unwieldy. We can have a navigation bar linking to category pages, with dedicated top-level sections:

*   **Development**
*   **Data Research**
*   **Evaluations & Experiments:** I am very interested in this area.
*   **Resource Lists:** This is a better name than "Awesome Lists."
*   **Claude Code:** Definitely a key area.
*   **MCP (Minecraft Protocol):** A significant category.
*   **Voice & Speech Tools:** Another main area of focus in AI.
*   **Apps & GUIs:** This should be its own top-level thing.
*   **Documentation:** This is already embedded in the website but should also be its own page.

These represent my main areas of focus within AI and the projects I'm working on, providing a top-level overview.

### Addressing Duplication in Current Categories

There is some duplication in the existing categories page that needs to be resolved:

*   **Indices and Awesome Lists:** There is no need for both. These should be consolidated into a single "Resource List" or similar, as "Resource List" is a more appropriate name.
*   **MCP Servers and MCP Integrations:** These should be combined into one consolidated list of all my MCP projects.

### Backend Process for Content

The process for displaying projects generally involves pulling data from GitHub and Hugging Face into a backend JSON data file with some filtering. This data is then spread out to the category pages. We might need to implement this categorization editing at that backend data file level rather than directly on the website.
