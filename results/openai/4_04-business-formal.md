Certainly. Here is the transcription and revision in a more formal and professional tone:

I would like to outline several edits for my personal website, specifically focusing on the projects homepage, as it is important for showcasing my work. 

One of the projects I had listed is "My Word Prompts," which refers to a podcast that I have been planning for some time. However, it’s currently incorrectly labeled as a full-fledged project, which it is not. The current use of purple as a highlight color appears unprofessional and needs to be changed.

The term "projects" should encompass both my technology-oriented repositories as well as my publishing-related initiatives. For example, "My Word Prompts" belongs under a section we could label "Content." While content does overlap with an existing dropdown, we can describe this particular project as an AI-generated podcast. It’s distinct from the "3,000+ Prompts" project, so they should not be conflated. The concept here is that I provide prompts, and AI-generated responses form the podcast episodes.

The projects homepage is important as a central place to display my active work without delving too deeply into excessive detail. I would prefer the main organization on the page to focus on key categories. These categories should be:

1. Evaluations and Experiments – an area of great interest to me.
2. Resource Lists – currently referred to as “Awesome Lists”, which I believe should be renamed for clarity.
3. Claude Code – a collection I want to highlight specifically.
4. MCP (likely referring to a specific project or integration that needs standalone attention).
5. Voice and Speech Tools – an important area of focus for my AI work.

We can still maintain a category for Data, but I believe the organization would benefit more by linking each top-level category to its respective detail page.

Some of these categories, especially in the domain of tools such as apps and graphical user interfaces (GUIs), span across multiple focus areas. Hence, it is essential to have a dedicated category for Apps (including GUIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and related scripts. This gives users a comprehensive understanding of the various utilities I have created.

The best approach might be to use the main projects page as a landing page with the top-level categories I’ve identified. From there, we should have a navigation bar that links to the respective category pages. These categories would be:
- By Category (for the categorized listing),
- Apps (to encompass various tools and utilities),
- Documentation (a standalone page that is already embedded within the site).

In terms of existing categories, we also need to handle some duplication. For example, there’s redundancy between "Indices and Awesome Lists" and "Awesome Lists" itself. We should consolidate these under the term "Resource Lists" to maintain uniformity. Similarly, "MCP Servers" and "MCP Integrations" should be merged into a single comprehensive list of MCP projects.

The website’s data structure is currently fed by pulling information from GitHub and Hugging Face repositories into a backend JSON file, with certain filters applied. In order to realize these categorization improvements, we will likely need to make adjustments at that backend data level rather than modifying the front-end pages alone.

We can proceed with these structural changes moving forward to ensure a cleaner and more effective organization of the projects page.
