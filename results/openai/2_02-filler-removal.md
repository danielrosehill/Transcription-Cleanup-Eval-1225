Here's a cleaned-up transcription of your task list with all the filler words and verbal stumbles removed:

I'm working on getting the home office ready. We're almost there; I just have a few boxes to sort away and then get the rest of the stuff into the inventory. I'm trying to be decisive about throwing away old stuff I don't need anymore.

I have a call from 6:15 to 7:15. That's one hour, and I really can't go over that time because I need to get around to other things. Hanukkah starts on Sunday, so I'm trying to have a nice, clean workspace ahead of that.

I'm not sure if the storm is happening or going to happen. I have a package to pick up, which is important. It's the macro pad for Kdenlive editing, and I really want to get that before they close at 7, so I need to do that before the call.

Before the call, I’d like to post a few ideas based on the speech that was uploaded. I need to format them as short posts and then reformat the speech as a longer post. The main feedback was that if you don’t break it up into paragraphs, a long speech on a website isn’t the best presentation. A lot of the success or challenge in this kind of messaging comes down to presentation. Front-end design is part of that because it can be a powerful way of presenting information in a more modular fashion.
