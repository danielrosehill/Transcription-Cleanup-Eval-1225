Okay, these are some notes for the next time I run Claude, uh, helping me develop the website, um, My Word Proms.

So, homepage, page by page review. Homepage, um, new header looks really good. Like it an awful lot, actually. Um, "Human curiosity meets AI exploration." Maybe just that subtitle a little bit bolder? And then we have, the next item is "What is My Word Proms?" and we have the intro. I think it would actually be better if we just had a button in the center called "About This Podcast." And then beneath that—because the concept is pretty... is pretty straightforward: I record prompts, they get sent to an, um... AI model, it generates a podcast episode using text-to-speech voices. But all that detail is... is better... better kept for the About Page. So I just want to have the essential here: "How this works." Second title: "Human—or Daniel records prompts, AI answers, episode generation." And if we can use icons for those three labels with the standard icon library... and I like the dark blue very much. I think that's a good palette for the project. Um, so long as— and that kind of silver-white gradient for the actual text on top of it creates good color contrast. Um, so let's try to stick with that.

"Latest Episodes" and "All Episodes." These titles, I think, would be better off a bit bigger and center aligned. Um, and the font is good, but for the... for the... for these f—the... the font for these elements, the headers, I think we could use something a bit more creative and imaginative.

Um, in terms of then the top navigation bar, I think the, um, the order can be Episodes... About... Pipeline can be subsumed—or rather a sub-menu under About, in a dropdown.

And then for the moment, um, the Contact Page, we... I think we can get rid of "got a weird prompt?" inviting people to send in prompts, 'cause I don't think that's gonna be viable for a while at least. And, uh, let's try to just use the background— that blue background here, and then just on one level. I don't think we need a car— a card for each of these boxes. Just, like, show email, contact email, website, GitHub. Like little buttons. I think that's... that's sufficient for providing a way for anyone to get in touch if they want to.
