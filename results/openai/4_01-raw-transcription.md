Okay, so some editing instructions for my personal website… um… I haven't looked at this in a while.

Okay, so for the projects homepage, which is kind of important because I like to share what I’m working on… um… I asked… I wanted “My Word Prompts” as the podcast that I’ve been planning for a while… um… so okay…

I don’t— I didn’t want “flagship project” to be actually written and purple looks kinda stupid… um… and projects kind of encompasses both tech repositories as well as publishing efforts. So, for example, “My Word Prompts” is… I would say we can have a section here called “content” and there’s a bit of overlap with the content dropdown… um… but it can be this project… uh… AI generated podcast, it can actually be described as… and it's not 3000+ prompts. That’s a different project completely. Um… this one is just, um, AI generated podcast. I provide prompts, they get… read… um… in the form of an AI response, and that gets combined into one episode. That’s the concept of it.

So… I was… the projects homepage is important because I want to just sort of have a place where, you know, I kind of show the stuff that I’m working on without getting swamped in all these… all, you know, the detail because there’s a lot of stuff that I’ve been adding to the site.

So… maybe we can have… dropdown elements within “development,” “data,” “research”… and I think there’s actually more to it than that. I’m just looking under projects. We have… I click on “by category,” the main ones… evaluations and experiments are something I’m very interested in… awesomelists… uh… resource lists is how we refer to them. So I think that could be… “Claude code,” definitely… um… and “MCP.” Those would be the big ones… and “voice and speech tools.” Those are the big ones where I’d say my main areas of focus in AI, on the projects I’m working on, those would be like kind of the top levels I’d like to kind of… highlight here.

So I think that like data— data is a good one to have. Um, but that would be a better… organization and then maybe linking off to those category pages.

And some of these— some of these— the question is really, what’s the kind of hierarchy here… um… so, those ones I defined are kind of… I guess things like apps and GUIs, I like to have that as a category because I want people to… you know, anyone wants to like see any utilities I’ve created. I like— that’s important to have as a page, but it might span… um… apps, CLIs, because that’s a very big category, we have CLIs, GUIs, scripts, across different categories.

So… maybe the best way to do that is to have… this as the landing page, as it is, with the top levels I defined, and then… a navigation bar with… linking to category pages by category… “apps” as its own… thing, as its own top level, and “documentation,” which we already have… um… kind of embedded into the website… as its own page. But that’s a common one as well. So I think those are the ones that I’d like to kind of… reorganize a little bit.

And then in the categories page that exists currently we have some duplication. As an example… there is “indexes and awesome lists” which is great… because I usually just— I usually just call them resource lists—that’d be a better name to be honest. And then we have “awesome lists” and there’s definitely no need for both. Those should be consolidated.

Likewise, “MCP servers,” “MCP integrations,” that, we should have one consolidated list of my MCP projects. Um, so those are all the kind of combinations. And I know the process is generally… um… you can see how it’s documented, but it’s a pull from GitHub and Hugging Face to… a backend data file, a JSON file, with a bit of filtering… and then we kind of… spread out to the category pages. So… we might need to implement those— that categorization edits at that level as opposed to here, but um… let’s— let’s work on those changes.
