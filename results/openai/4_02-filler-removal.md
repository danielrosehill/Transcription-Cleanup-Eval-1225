Okay, here’s the cleaned-up version of your audio transcription with all the filler words and redundancies removed.

I have some editing instructions for my personal website. I haven't looked at this in a while.

For the Projects homepage, which is important because I like to share what I’m working on, I wanted "My Word Prompts," the podcast that I’ve been planning for a while, to be included. I didn’t want “Flagship Project” to be actually written in purple because it looks a bit off.

"Projects" encompasses both tech repositories as well as publishing efforts. For example, "My Word Prompts" is an AI-generated podcast project. It’s not the same as the "3,000+ Prompts" project. This one is just an AI-generated podcast where I provide prompts, they get read as AI responses, and those are combined into one episode. That’s the concept.

The Projects homepage is important because I want a place to show what I’m working on without getting swamped in detail. There’s a lot of stuff I’ve been adding to the site.

We can have dropdown elements within areas like Development, Data, and Research. I think there’s more to it. Looking under Projects by category, the main ones are "Evaluations and Experiments," which I’m very interested in, "Resource Lists" (a better term for "Awesome Lists"), "Claude Code," "MCP," and "Voice and Speech Tools." Those would be the big ones, my main areas of focus in AI and the projects I’m working on. Those are the top levels I’d like to highlight.

"Data" is good to have, but it would be better to organize it differently and link off to the category pages.

The main question is about hierarchy. The categories I defined are important. I also like to have a category for "Apps and GUIs" because I want people to see any utilities I’ve created. That category would include apps, CLIs, GUIs, and scripts across different fields.

Maybe the best way is to have this as the landing page, with the top levels I’ve defined, and then a navigation bar linking to category pages by category. "Apps" should be its own top-level category. "Documentation" is another important page that’s already embedded into the website. That should also be its own page.

For the category pages, there’s duplication. For example, there are “Indexes” and “Awesome Lists.” I usually call them "Resource Lists," which would be a better name, and we definitely don’t need both categories. Those should be consolidated. Likewise, we have “MCP Servers” and “MCP Integrations.” There should be one consolidated list of MCP projects. Those sorts of combinations should be used.

The general process is documented. It’s a pull from GitHub and Hugging Face to a backend data JSON file with some filtering, and then that data is spread out to the category pages. We might need to implement the categorization edits at the backend data file level instead of just at the frontend level, but let’s work on those changes.

That’s the cleaned-up version with the original meaning and intent preserved. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
