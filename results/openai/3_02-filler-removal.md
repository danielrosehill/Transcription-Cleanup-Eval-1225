Here is the cleaned-up transcription of the audio:

These are some notes for the next time I run Claude, helping me develop the website MyWordPrompts.

Homepage – page-by-page review. The new header looks really good. I like it an awful lot, actually. “Human curiosity meets AI exploration” – maybe just that subtitle a little bit bolder. The next item is “What is MyWordPrompts?” and we have the intro. I think it would actually be better if we just had a button in the center called “About this Podcast” and then beneath that, because the concept is pretty straightforward – I record prompts, they get sent to an AI model, it generates podcast episodes using text-to-speech voices – all that detail is better kept for the about page. I just want to have the essentials here.

“How this works” – second title – “Daniel records prompts,” “AI answers,” “Episode generation.” If we can use icons for those three labels with the standard icon library. I like the dark blue very much. I think that's a good palette for the project. That silver-white gradient for the actual text on top of it creates good color contrast, so let's try to stick with that.

“Latest episodes” and “All episodes” – these titles I think would be better off a bit bigger and center-aligned. The font is good, but for these elements, the headers, I think we could use something a bit more creative and imaginative.

In terms of the top navigation bar, the order can be Episodes, About. Pipeline can be subsumed, or rather a submenu under About, in a drop-down.

For the moment, on the contact page, I think we can get rid of “Got a weird prompt?” inviting people to send in prompts because I don't think that's going to be viable for a while at least. Let's try to just use that blue background here, and then just on one level. I don’t think we need a card for each of these boxes. Just show email, contact email, website, GitHub – little buttons – I think that’s sufficient for providing a way for anyone to get in touch if they want to.
