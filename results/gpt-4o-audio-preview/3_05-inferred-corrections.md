Here are some notes for the next time I run Claude helping me develop the website "My Word Prompts":

Homepage, page-by-page review:

Homepage: The new header looks really good. I like it an awful lot actually—“Human curiosity meets AI exploration.” Maybe just that subtitle a little bit bolder.

Then we have the next item: "What is My Word Prompts?" and we have the intro. I think it would actually be better if we just had a button in the center labeled "About This Podcast" and then beneath that, because the concept is pretty straightforward—I record prompts, they get sent to an AI model, it generates podcast episodes using text-to-speech voices—but all that detail is better kept for the About page. So I just want to have the essentials here—how this works: 

Second title: "Human (or 'Daniel') records prompts. AI answers. Episode generation." And if we can use icons for those three labels with a standard icon library. 

I like the dark blue very much. I think that’s a good palette for the project, and that kind of silver-white gradient for the actual text on top of it creates good color contrast, so let’s try to stick with that.

“Latest Episodes” and “All Episodes”—these titles I think would be better off a bit bigger and center-aligned. The font is good, but for the headers, I think we could use something a bit more creative and imaginative.

In terms of the top navigation bar, I think the order can be: Episodes, About, and Pipeline can be subsumed—or rather a sub-menu under About in a dropdown. 

And then for the moment, the Contact page, I think we can get rid of “Got a Word Prompt?”—inviting people to send in prompts—because I don’t think that’s going to be viable for a while at least. Let’s try to just use that blue background here and then just on one level. I don’t think we need a card for each of these boxes—just like show email, contact email, website, GitHub—little buttons. I think that’s sufficient for providing a way for anyone to get in touch if they want to.
