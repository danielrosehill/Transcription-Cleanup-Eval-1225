I’m working on a quick task list of things I’m trying to get done today. There’s no particular order right now, but it would be great to organize these better.

Looking around my home office, it’s almost done. Just a few boxes left to sort away and get the rest of the items into the inventory. I’m trying to be pretty decisive about throwing away the old stuff I don’t need anymore.

I have a call from 6:15 to 7:15. That’s exactly one hour, and I can’t go over that time because I need to get these other things done. Hanukkah starts on Sunday, so I’m trying to have a nice clean workspace before then.

I’m not sure if the storm is going to happen or not.

I have a package to pick up—it’s important. It’s the macro pad for Kdenlive editing, so I really want to get that. The usual collection place closes at 7, so I need to do that before the call.

Before the call, I’d like to get a couple of things done. I’m not sure if I’ll manage it in time, but I want to post a few short pieces based on the speech that was uploaded, plus reformat it as a longer post. The main feedback I received was that if you don’t break it up into paragraphs, a big long speech on the website doesn’t present well.

I think how successful the message is often comes down to presentation. Front-end design contributes to that, because it can be a powerful way of presenting information more modularly.
