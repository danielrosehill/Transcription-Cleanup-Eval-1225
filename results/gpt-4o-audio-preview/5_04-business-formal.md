Certainly, here is the transformed text in a professional, business-formal tone:

I would like to organize a review and analysis of my personal website as part of an end-of-year assessment. The live version of the website is available at danielrosell.com, while its corresponding development repository can be found here.

Over the past year, I have implemented several iterations of the website. The current version retrieves project data from sources such as GitHub and Hugging Face, and we have entirely phased out the use of Contentful, a headless CMS, which I now solely use for my blog. The website is relatively light on textual content, and a CMS seemed unnecessarily complex for this purpose.

The primary objective of my personal website is to consolidate my ongoing projects and provide a single point of reference for individuals seeking to learn more about my professional work. Additionally, I am active on multiple platforms, including YouTube and podcasting, which I aim to resume in the future. A centralized web presence is crucial for directing interested parties to my various undertakings and providing a means of contact.

With respect to the website's written content, I have deliberately utilized AI-generated text for certain sections, such as my biography. This approach was intended to add a layer of objectivity and distance, avoiding the common challenge of writing about oneself. Although I view the current content as satisfactory, I am questioning whether it should incorporate more personal elements while maintaining a professional emphasis on my work rather than myself as an individual.

The website also contains a “Hiring” section. This is not intended to function as a direct solicitation for work; rather, it serves to redirect users to my business website where necessary. One ongoing technical issue I have encountered is the inconsistent rendering of icons during page load or refresh, causing an undesirable visual effect. This requires a resolution, and I would appreciate any insights you can offer.

Additionally, I am considering structural improvements to the information hierarchy. The current organization includes separate sections for documentation (given my involvement in creating technical documents) and general content, which aggregates the various smaller pieces of content I produce. However, I feel the overall flow could be refined for better clarity and user experience.

Ultimately, the website does not have a singular, sharply-defined objective, such as job solicitation or personal storytelling. Instead, its aim is to serve as an integrated hub for my professional activities and projects. The website has proven useful for external contacts and networking, and I would like to further enhance its accessibility and utility—for both humans and AI tools. From a technical perspective, I am interested in creating a clear site hierarchy and ensuring it is as AI-friendly as possible, aligning with my belief in making content widely accessible.

With these goals in mind, I welcome your thoughts on potential improvements, including refinements to structure, hierarchy, design, and any other aspects that could enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the site.
