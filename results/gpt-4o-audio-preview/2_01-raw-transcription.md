Okay, um just a quick task list of things that I'm working on today and I'm trying to get done, uh in no particular order whatsoever, but it would be cool to organize these into some kind of a… an organized format. Uh looking around at my—at the home office, well we’re almost there, um I just have a few boxes to sort away and then get the rest of the stuff into the inventory, um and I’m being pretty—trying to be pretty decisive about just like throwing uh old stuff away that I don’t need anymore. Um I have a call at 6:15 to uh 7:15, that’s one hour, and I really can’t go over that time because um I need to get—get round to all these things. Hanukkah starts on Sunday so I’m trying to just have a nice clean workspace ahead of then. Um I don’t know if the storm is… happening or going to happen. Uh I have a package to pick up, it’s important it’s the Macropad for Kdenlive editing, uh so I really want to get that and um that’s in uh the usual place for collections, so I—they close at 7 so I need to actually get that done before the call.

And I think a lot of the success or challenge in this kind of messaging comes down to simply to presentation and strangely front-end is kind of a… um part of that picture because front-end design can actually be quite a powerful way of presenting information more modular— in a more modular fashion.
