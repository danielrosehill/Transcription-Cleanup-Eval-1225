Okay, here’s a prompt that I’d like you to work with. Rather than just giving tasks, let’s get some thoughts that you can suggest, and I can tell you which ones I like. We’ll create an AI analysis folder in this repository. If there isn’t already one, let’s make that folder.

The goal is to do a quick end-of-year review of my personal website. The deployed site is danielrosell.com, and this is the repository for working on it. We’ve gone through a few versions this year. This current version is an updated model that pulls project data from source, mainly from GitHub and Hugging Face. I think we’ve mostly gotten rid of the Contentful approach, which was using a headless CMS. I’m using that for my blog now, but it was just too complicated for this website since it’s not particularly content-rich.

I’ll tell you what the objectives are for this website. I’m doing a lot of AI development projects and various activities this year. I also have some YouTube channels that I want to get back into, as well as some podcasts. I think it’s important to have a consolidated space on the internet where anyone who’s curious or wants to get in touch can find a list of the different things I’m working on.

I’ve leaned into using AI tools with direction, so some of the things written on the site weren’t actually written by me. I did that deliberately because I wanted some distance between me writing bios and having AI-generated ones. The one I have currently is pretty decent, but I’m not sure if it’s the best approach or if there should be more of my personal story.

The website is definitely professionally oriented, more about sharing my work than about me personally. There’s a bit of a hiring hook as well. There are some issues with how the icons load; they kind of move around when the page refreshes, and it looks really bad. I haven’t figured that out yet, and I’d love to know if you can help fix it.

The hiring page is mainly feeding into my business site at the moment. Eventually, I want to have a proper website for that. I like the content on my personal site and want to keep it, but the hierarchy, the structure, and the flow could be more logical than they are right now.

Initially, documentation had its own section because I create docs, but now the “Content” section gathers little bits of the various content I create. So, the site isn’t just a “hire me” type of website, and it’s not just an “about me” website either. It’s more like a clearinghouse or an aggregated presentation layer for all the work I'm involved in, without a specific overarching objective.

I do get a significant amount of contacts through the website, so it’s useful for people to find me. I also want it to be as AI-friendly as possible—I believe in making whatever content I can available to AI. That’s reflected in the footer design and technically as well.

If there are any things that should be done differently to create a clearer hierarchy or a map, that’s something I’d like to focus on as well.
